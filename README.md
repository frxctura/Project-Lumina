Project Lumina is a JavaFX-based cracking tool designed to automate the process of cracking games. Developed solely by me, this tool provides a seamless interface for selecting game directories, managing backups, and applying cracks using the Goldberg Steam Emu.

## Features
- **Automatic Cracking**: Streamlined process for cracking games with minimal user intervention.
- **Directory Selection**: Easily select game directories through a user-friendly interface.
- **Backup Management**: Option to back up existing `steam_api.dll` files before applying cracks.
- **Automatic Downloads**: Automatically download and extract necessary dependencies.
- **Logging**: Provides real-time status updates and logging functionality.

## Roadmap
- **Display Game Information**: Integrate features to display game information if possible.
- **Move Game Folder After Cracking**: Implement functionality to move the game folder post-cracking. [DONE]
- **Backup Entire Game Directory**: Extend backup capabilities to include the entire game directory, not just DLL files. [DONE]
- **Switch Goldberg Versions**: Allow users to switch between old and newer Goldberg versions, including newly maintained forks.
- **Switch Emulators**: Allow users to select specific emulators for the game.

## How It Works
1. **Select Game Directory**: Users select their game directory through a graphical interface.
2. **Backup Option**: Users can choose to back up existing `steam_api.dll` files.
3. **Automatic Cracking Process**: Once the directory is selected and settings are chosen, the tool automatically handles the cracking process, including downloading necessary dependencies if they are missing.
4. **Logging**: Real-time status updates are displayed, and logging to a file is optional based on user settings.

## Current Status
Project Lumina is currently under development and will not be released at this time. Stay tuned for updates and potential future releases.
